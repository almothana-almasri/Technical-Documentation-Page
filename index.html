            <p>Here is the technical documentation for JavaScript and Java.</p>
            <p>JavaScript and Java are both programming languages commonly used in web development. While they have some
                similarities, they are also quite different in many ways.</p>
            <p>JavaScript is a scripting language that is primarily used to add interactivity to web pages. It is often
                used in conjunction with HTML and CSS to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces. JavaScript is a
                client-side language, which means that it runs on the user's computer rather than on the web server.</p>
            <p>Here are some key differences between JavaScript and Java:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>JavaScript is a scripting language, while Java is a full-fledged programming language.</li>
                <li>JavaScript is primarily used for client-side scripting, while Java can be used for a wide range of
                    applications.</li>
                <li>JavaScript is interpreted, while Java is compiled.</li>
                <li>JavaScript is dynamically typed, while Java is statically typed.</li>
                <li>JavaScript has a simpler syntax than Java.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Here are some examples of JavaScript code:</p>
            <code>
            // Declare a variable
            let myVariable = "Hello, world!";
          
            // Use an if statement
            if (myVariable.length > 0) {
              console.log("myVariable has a value!");
            } else {
              console.log("myVariable is empty!");
            }
          </code>
            <p>Here are some resources to learn more about JavaScript and Java:</p>

            <header>HTML_and_CSS</header>
            <p>Here is the technical documentation for HTML and CSS.</p>
            <p>HTML and CSS are the building blocks of web development. HTML is used to create the structure of a web
                page,
                while CSS is used to style and layout the content. Together, they form the foundation of web design and
                development.</p>
            <p>Here are some examples of HTML code:</p>
            <code>
            <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>
            <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>
            <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>
            <ul>
                <li>Selectors</li>
                <li>Properties</li>
                <li>Values</li>
                <li>Classes</li>
                <li>ID's</li>
            </ul>
            <code>&lt;/head&gt;</code>
            </code>
            <p>Here are some examples of CSS code:</p>
            <code>
        body {
          background-color: #f0f0f0;
          font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
        }
        
        h1 {
          color: #333;
          font-size: 2em;
        }
        
        ul {
          list-style-type: none;
          margin: 0;
          padding: 0;
        }
        
        li {
          margin: 0 0 1em 0;
        }

            <p>Here is the technical documentation for Python.</p>
            <p>Python is a high-level programming language that is used for a wide range of applications. It is known
                for its simplicity and ease of use, making it a popular choice among developers and beginners alike.</p>
            <p>Here are some examples of Python code:</p>
            <code>
        # Declare a variable
        my_variable = "Hello, world!"
        
        # Use an if statement
        if len(my_variable) > 0:
            print("my_variable has a value!")
        else:
            print("my_variable is empty!")

            <header>Cplusplus</header>
            <p>Here is the technical documentation for C++.</p>
            <p>C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed as an extension of the C programming
                language. It is a compiled language, which means that the code is translated into machine language
                before it is executed.</p>
            <p>C++ is commonly used in developing operating systems, device drivers, and high-performance software
                applications.</p>
            <p>Here are some examples of C++ code:</p>
            <pre><code>
      #include <iostream>
    
      int main() {
        std::cout << "Hello, world!" << std::endl;
        return 0;
      }

            <header>Database_Management</header>
            <p>Here is the technical documentation for database management.</p>
            <p>Database management is the process of organizing and maintaining data in a database. A database is a
                collection of data that is organized in a way that allows for efficient retrieval and manipulation.</p>
            <p>There are several types of database management systems, including relational database management systems
                (RDBMS), NoSQL databases, and object-oriented databases.</p>
            <p>Here are some examples of database management code:</p>
            <code>
      SELECT * FROM customers;
    
      INSERT INTO customers (name, email) VALUES ('John Doe', 'john@example.com');
    
      UPDATE customers SET email='jane@example.com' WHERE id=1;
    
      DELETE FROM customers WHERE id=2;
